# LEDWebsiteControl

## About 
This code controls LED lights with a website running on your local network and is written so that anyone can add functionality without understanding how all of the code works. Moreover, this project is structured to be deployed as an apache server and includes apache server-specific config files.  
(more on that below). If you don't want to use apache, skip my install guide, and re-arrange files for whatever server you want to run it on.
